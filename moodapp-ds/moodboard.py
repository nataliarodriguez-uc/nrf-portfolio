# Load Google Sheets Data

## Instructions: 
# - scope is standard in Google Sheets and should not be changed. 
# - Only alter creds with the name of the credentials file downloaded from Goodle Drive API.
# - Use sheets_url to connect to Google Sheet file with URL.
# - If multiple sheets are used, change sheet1 in sheet to the name of the sheet with Moodboard_LogSheet data.

# User Interface Application 

## Instructions: 
# - Change the title using st.title() as desired. 
# - Provide the user with different options to log their daily mochi_mood. Note: changing or renaming the options could result in app error and data log. 
# - Add a text input for users to add additional comments on their mood for the day.
# - Use the st.button() to submit the mood and note to the Google Sheets document.

# Data Visualization on Streamlit

## Instructions: 
# - Appl will refresh every 60 seconds.
# - Use the get_all_records() method to retrieve all data from the Google Sheets document.
# - Check that the dataframe is not empty (contains the headers in order to continue).
# - mochimood_* contains the dataframe as established for the filters, dates and mood selection for the backend and front end filtering.
